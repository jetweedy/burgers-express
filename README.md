This Node.js app demonstrates using a model that access a more generic ORM to communicate with MySQL. On the front end, Handlebars is used for dynamically rendering the view.

## Running the App

2. Download this folder
3. Open your command line and enter the folder
4. Build and seed the database
```
  mysql << db/schema.sql
  mysqk << db/seed.sql
 
```
5. Run the app (port 8080)
```
  npm start
```
Once the app is running, then it should be accessible at http://localhost:8080 (or an equivalent if you're using a virtual machine or something).
